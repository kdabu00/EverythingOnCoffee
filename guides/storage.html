				<p>Always make sure to preserve your beans fresh roasted flavor as long as possible! The greatest threats for your coffee is air, moisture, heat and light. Make sure to keep your coffee stored in an air-tight container at room temperature, avoid clear containers. Keep the coffee in a dark cool location away from heat sources. The retail packaging is generally not the ideal for long-term storage so it's a good investment to buy some storage canisters.</p>
				<p>Coffee begins to lose freshness almost immediately after roasting, Try to buy smaller amounts of fresh coffee more frequently enough for one or two weeks.</p>
