				<h3>Discovery</h3>
				<p>It was said that in the 9th century that coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian goat-herder named Kaldi. He noticed his goats behaving differently after eating the red berries from a nearby coffee tree, and after trying some himself he himself began to feel the effects. He brought a batch to a nearby monastery where they were disapproved of for their stimulating effects during prayer. The religious leaders threw the beens onto a fire to destroy them, but the aroma of the roasted beans convinced them to give coffee another try.</p>
				<h3>How it Got Here</h3>
				<p>Trade of coffee beans began in Arabic countries during the 14th century and spread throughout Egypt, Syria, and Turkey as no coffee plants did not exist outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s. Slowly the plant found its way to Europe and then to America due to British colonizers who came to New York City.
